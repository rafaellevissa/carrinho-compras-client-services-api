## INSTALL

Once you have the project on your computer, you just need to install the dependencies with npm:

```
npm install
```

After everything is installed, change the credencials at `.env` and run it with the folowing command:

```
npm start
```

### Install with Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can run the project with Docker. Make sure the `.env` file is correctly set up, and then build a Docker image using the following command:

```
docker compose build
```

Once the image is built, start the container:
