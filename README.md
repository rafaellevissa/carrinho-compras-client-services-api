# Allu Challenge - API Services

This repository contains all the API services for the Allu challenge.

## How to Run the Services

To run all the services, you can access each service in the `services` folder and execute it using Docker Compose or npm locally. Remember to modify the `.env` file. The `.env.example` file is already configured to run locally with Docker, so if you're using Docker Compose, simply copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env`.
